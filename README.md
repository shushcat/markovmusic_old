# Markov Music
A program which attempts to adduce the genre of pieces of music
(in a variety of formats supported by
[music21](https://github.com/kroger/music21)) by using
nearest-neighbor frequencies to to ID pieces then diffing pieces
and clustering based on similarity.

In its current state, this project requires a fair amount of
hacking around to produce results.
